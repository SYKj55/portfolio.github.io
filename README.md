### Projects

Face recognition using CNN :                                                                                                         
- Implemented a model using VGG-16 model with transfer learning and triplet loss function trained on the vggface2 dataset. Preprocessed the data to fit model specifications.
- built a siamese network to train and pickle module in python to dump features.
- deployed the model on flask to capture and effectively recognize users using the cv2 and urllib modules in python.

Used car price prediction using ML:                                                                                                 
- Extracted the best features for prediction using EDA and eliminated features with high cross correlation.
- Implemented multiple regression models like random forest, ridge and linear regression to find the best model for prediction
- Trained models for detection of make,model as well as scratches on the car image and deployed the models on streamlit

Natural language processing: 
- Designed a scraper to scrape texts from several blogs and websites
- Performed basic analysis on the collected data using NLP methods like bag of words and TFIDF
- applied sentiment analysis to the stemmed data

EDA and predictive analysis
- A series of projects focused on analysing different datasets
- cleaned and organised data, performed feature engineering, visualized the data and applied classification or regression algorithms depending on the requirement
- tested multiple algorithms for a comparative view on the results of each
